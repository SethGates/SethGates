Hi! Im Seth. I aspire to become a full stack developer and make changes that will effect millions for the better.

I am transitioning from Active Duty Service in the U.S. Army, and am using every resource I can to be successful.

I love to learn, and believe in the "Forever a student" mindset, regardless of how good I am at something.
